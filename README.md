# A Raven's Guide through the Digital Woods

The woods are only scary until you learn to find food. Then it becomes home.

## Forward
I'm writing this book because I've learned how to extract tremendous
long-term value by demanding the highest standard of treatment from
service providers, product manufacturers, and software developers.

You're an honest person who deserves optimal solutions to your problems.
These are solutions that deliver the most time-savings for the best price.

This book is designed to deliver strategic and permanent value from
an experienced perspective. The sooner you implement these practices,
the more of your life you will get to enjoy doing business with those
you respect.

These lessons should be understandable by anyone using the internet. A
rule of thumb for non-technical readers going in; If you trust your child
to use the internet then you should read this book.

## Think like a Raven
Ravens have pretty good lives for birds. They're flexible in their food
sources. They find food enough in their woods for them and their kin.
They're clever and fun enough to play tricks on other animals.

Cooperatively they work with otherwise vicious animals by leading with
value. What wolf doesn't value a scout?

In literature they represent resolve and a standard of excellence. They
instill fear in those caught under their shadow, but oppresion was only
ever in the eye of the beholder.

And they can soar.

## The Internet and Privacy
The internet is just computers talking to each other. It is *just*
infrastructure and no company has the ability to prevent you from
travelling wherever you wish to go in private.

Despite the practical obstacles to this desire, any digital raven is
is required to maintain this mindset to create an uncompromising experience.
You're skilled enough to meaningfully understand the internet and travel it
with self-respect. It's easy so let's begin.

## Strong email and passwords
The opening chapter concerns email because email remains the most consistent
way for reasonable people to login to services on the internet.

It may be tempting to use one password and email for everything. I used
to do that until my Facebook was hacked and I was embarrased in front of
all my friends. I also had to manually change my password across near
100 accounts because I used similar credentials almost everywhere. In
a worse world that could have been my bank account.

If we just use one email address and one password everywhere to save initial
brainpower then we may find ourselves on the news in a data breach. The
initial inconvenience of organizing credentials is *much* more worthwhile
than calling a legal firm over identity theft.

Our goal is to create an organization where all of our login credentials
are recoverable in one private place. A Raven has several requirements
for their email providers.
- Secure and reliable. It must be up near-constantly and viewed as impervious
  to criminal attack. We will only be viewed as victims if our provider
  is an outright liar.
- Privacy focused. We should be able to create an account without them
  knowing anything about us other than our humanity.
- It must have intuitive folder and organization structure.
- 2FA must be an **option**.

We will create 2 or 
- Core email: This is your main email you will use to gather all service
  providers under one roof. This must be a standalone email account.
- Emergency email: This is the email account of last resort for naked recovery.
  This will allow you to lose everything you own and still get back online.
- Personal email: Use this as a contact for your government issued identity.
  Ravens don't play stupid games with people who point guns at us.

We will also need to memorize the passwords for our core and emergency email.
These can be the same password since the emergency email will forever remain
a secret, no attacker should ever be able to link it to passwords

## Unconventional password security
Password security is easy.

- Never change them unless required.

### Provider
There are many competant providers of email, but a Raven only needs one. Let's
choose the best one.

The email I trust the most is ProtonMail.
- You can make an account there without telling them your name or setting up 2FA.
  This makes them the easiest to set up.
- You can access them with any popular web-browser.
- 
  
easiest to set up. This will serve us well.

Use ProtonMail for your Core email.
