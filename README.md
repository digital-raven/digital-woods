# A Raven's Guide through the Digital Woods

The woods are only scary until you learn to find food. Then it becomes home.

## Forward
I'm writing this book because I've learned how to extract tremendous
long-term value by demanding the highest standard of treatment from
service providers, product manufacturers, and software developers.

You're an honest person who deserves optimal solutions to your problems.
These are solutions that deliver the most time-savings for the best price.

This book is designed to deliver strategic and permanent value from
an experienced perspective. The sooner you implement these practices,
the more of your life you will get to enjoy doing business with those
you respect.

These lessons should be understandable by anyone using the internet. A
rule of thumb for non-technical readers going in; If you trust your child
to use the internet then you should read this book.

## Think like a Raven
Ravens have pretty good lives for birds. They're flexible in their food
sources. They find food enough in their woods for them and their kin.
They're fun enough to play tricks on other animals.

Cooperatively they work with otherwise vicious animals by leading with
value. What wolf doesn't value a scout?

In literature they represent resolve and a standard of excellence. They
instill fear in those caught under their shadow, but oppresion was only
ever in the eye of the beholder.

And they can soar.

## The Internet and Privacy
The internet is just computers talking to each other. It is *just*
infrastructure and no company has the ability to prevent you from
travelling wherever you wish to go in private.

Despite the practical obstacles to this desire, any digital raven is
is required to maintain this mindset to create an uncompromising experience.
You're skilled enough to meaningfully understand the internet and travel it
with self-respect. It's easy so let's begin.

## Email and passwords
The opening chapter concerns email because email remains the most consistent
way for reasonable people to login on the internet. When the chips are down,
send an email.

But if we just use one email address and one password everywhere to save
brainpower then we may find ourselves on the news in a data breach. The
initial inconvenience of organizing credentials is *much* more worthwhile
than calling a legal firm over identity theft.

Our goal is to minimize the number of credentials you need to maintain. We
will perform this by leveraging only a few email accounts and one password
manager.

- Core email: This is your main email you will use to gather all service
  providers under one roof. This must be a standalone email account.
- Backup email: You never tell anyone this. Emergency recovery goes here.
- Personal email: Use this as a contact for your government issued identity.
  Ravens don't play stupid games with people who point guns at us.

### Provider
There are many competant providers of email. For your personal
