# A Raven's Guide through the Digital Woods

## Forward
I'm writing this book because I've learned how to extract tremendous
long-term value by demanding the highest standard of treatment from
service providers, and product manufacturers, and software developers.

You're an honest person who deserves optimal solutions to your problems.
These are solutions that deliver the most time-savings for the best price.

This book is designed to deliver strategic and permanent value from
an experienced perspective. The sooner you implement these practices,
the more of your life you will get to enjoy doing business with those
you respect.
