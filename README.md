# A Raven's Guide through the Digital Woods

The woods are only scary until you learn to find food. Then it becomes home.

## Forward
I'm writing this book because I've learned how to extract tremendous
long-term value by demanding the highest standard of treatment from
service providers, product manufacturers, and software developers.

You're an honest person who deserves optimal solutions to your problems.
These are solutions that deliver the most time-savings for the best price.

This book is designed to deliver strategic and permanent value from
an experienced perspective. The sooner you implement these practices,
the more of your life you will get to enjoy doing business with those
you respect.

These lessons should be understandable by anyone using the internet. A
rule of thumb for non-technical readers going in; If you trust your child
to use the internet then you should read this book.

## Think like a Raven
Ravens have pretty good lives for birds. They find food enough in their
woods for them and their kin, and they're clever and fun enough to play
tricks on other animals and fly upside down.

They work cooperatively with otherwise vicious animals. What wolf doesn't
value a scout, and what raven would pass up the muscle?

In literature they represent resolve and a standard of excellence. They
instill fear in those caught under their shadow, but oppresion was only
ever in the eye of the beholder.

And they can soar.

## Understanding computers and the internet
Computers come in all shapes and sizes, but they all boil down to filing
cabinets that talk to each other. Each computer is just a filing cabinet
with folders in it, and little bots run around and organize the folders.

The internet is just the infrastructure to allow these filing cabinets to
talk to each other. We can do wonderful things like or

There are some files we should manage, but sometimes we should trust others.
If the problem is better solved long-term by doing it ourself, then we will
do it ourselves in a way such that we only need to solve it once. Our time
is all we have.

If we must pass on the work to someone else then we will watch them prove
themselves to others before we approach them. When we do we will be ultimately
trusting and friendly; as we are to any servents. We will also make clear to
ourselves what their strategic function is. If they screw around then we
can easily fire them. The labor market is heavily competitive in our favor, so
we should never tolerate misbehavior.

A raven maintains this mindset in order to create an uncompromising kit.
You're skilled enough to assemble such a kit so let's begin.
The goal of this book is to equip you with the ultimate network of virtual
filing cabinets. When you've done this you will have a permanent shelter
for your data that you truly own and can access anywhere with true privacy.

### Examples
I decided to write this book when I thought of all the ways my computer skills
helped those around me in meaningful ways. These were instances where regular
people were astounded by what I believed were simple tricks.

- I can access a private library of media I own anywhere in the world.
- I can easily take songs off youtube and rip the audio into an mp3 file in one
  command. I do this when the artist doesn't make it easy to buy their song.
- I've used data recovery software to save precious videos after an accidental
  deletion. I obtained this software legally, for free, and without an account.
- Simple command line tools make organizing and bulk-renaming.
- I have a personal development environment that I can bootstrap on any machine
  in the world starting from nothing other than an email account.
- My friends and I can play classic video games like Mario Party over the internet
  using legally free software installable with a single command and no account
  required.

## Strong email and passwords
The opening chapter concerns email because email remains the most consistent
way for reasonable people to login to services on the internet.

It may be tempting to use one password and email for everything. I used
to do that until my Facebook was hacked and I was embarrased in front of
all my friends. I also had to manually change my password across near
100 accounts because I used similar credentials almost everywhere. In
a worse world that could have been my bank account.

If we just use one email address and one password everywhere to save initial
brainpower then we may find ourselves on the news in a data breach. The
initial inconvenience of organizing credentials is *much* more worthwhile
than calling a legal firm over identity theft.

But memorizing lots of credentials is hard. Computers are great filing
cabinets. Let's create an organization that handles that for us. We need
only an email provider and a password manager.

### Selecting an email provider
Our goal is to create an organization where all of our login credentials
are recoverable in one private place. A Raven has several requirements
for their email providers.
- Secure and reliable.
- Anonymous until we break the seal. We tell who we are; our service
  providers don't.
- It must have intuitive folder and organization structure.
- 2FA must be an option because one email accounts will not have 2FA.

We will also need to memorize the passwords for our core and emergency email.
These can be the same password since the emergency email will forever remain
a secret, no attacker should ever be able to link it to passwords

### Unconventional password security
Password security is easy.
- Memorize as few passwords as possible.
- Never change a password have to remember, but give it the works; letters,
  numbers, symbols, long, and memorable. These are a pain to remember, so lets
  only have like 2 or 3 of these.
- Every other password will be randomly generated and managed by our one and
  only password manager.

I will note these rules do not pertain to organization accounts. Organizations
should help their members execute on these rules, but many don't and they're
immune to reason. If that's the case in your company then you should perform
the minimum.

There are many myths floating around about password security. I'll dispel a few.
- Changing your password does not make it more secure. An expert pen-tester
  named PirateSoftware would pwn accounts at Blizzard Entertainment because
  employees would just increment a number when forced to change.
- Strong passwords for most accounts aren't necessary with 2FA. 

### Email and password example
There are many competant providers of email, but a Raven only needs one. Let's
choose the best one.

The email I trust the most is ProtonMail. You can make an account there without
telling them your name or setting up 2FA. This makes them the easiest to set up.

The strongest thing about them is their brand, which uses simple language to
communicate their respect to you.

So we'll use ProtonMail for your core and emergency emails. We'll create 2 accounts
that look like this

- core.1234@proton.me
- emergency.1234@proton.me

## Personal computer

I recognize 2 main types of computers. Phones have their own section.

- Gaming / grahpics-focused computers, which are still best served as physical
  machines you own. Graphics cards are more expensive no matter who runs them.
- Any other computer is just for web-browsing or working.

Well if any other computer is *just* for working... I bet we can create a
mobile computing environment that lets us bring our
