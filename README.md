# A Raven's Guide through the Digital Woods

## Forward
I'm writing this book because I've learned how to demand tremendous
long-term value by demanding the highest standard of treatment from
service providers, and product manufacturers, and software developers.

The solutions in this book detail the motivations along with concrete
steps necessary to extract this value, but the main motivation is
respect. You're an honest person who deserves optimal solutions
to your problems; insulated from corporate and legal drama.

This book is designed to deliver strategic and permanent value from
an experienced perspective. The sooner you implement these practices,
the more of your life you will get to enjoy doing business with those
you respect.
